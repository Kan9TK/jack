# PCEAllyChecks [![Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/shield.dl/PCEAllyChecks)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PCEAllyChecks) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/330850307607363585?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/qmnDsSD)

PCEAllyChecks is an extension to the [PiggyCustomEnchants](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/) plugin which utilizes the AllyChecks feature introduced in [v2.1.0](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/pull/257).

Currently, the following plugins are supported:
* [FactionsPE](https://github.com/BlockHorizons/FactionsPE)
* [FactionsPro](https://github.com/poggit-orphanage/FactionsPro)
* [Slapper](https://github.com/jojoe77777/Slapper)
* [WorldGuard](https://github.com/Chalapa13/WorldGuard)

PCEAllyChecks will prevent certain custom enchants from affecting your faction members/allies:
* AutoAim
* Blaze
* Cactus
* Forcefield
* Homing Arrows
* Lightning
* Poisonous Cloud
* Wither Skull

It will also prevent custom enchantments from affecting [Slappers](https://github.com/jojoe77777/Slapper) + areas protected by [WorldGuard](https://github.com/Chalapa13/WorldGuard).
